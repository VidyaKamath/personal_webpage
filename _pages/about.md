I am a Master's student in the Department of Computer Science at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. George Chacko for my MS Thesis on an interesting topic in computational scientometrics - a comparative study between community search and community detection algorithms on real world networks. Prior to joining UIUC, I was working as a Software Engineer at Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions, Pvt. Ltd. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communications at NMAMIT, Nitte.

Areas of Interest:
======
Computational Scientometrics, Bioinformatics, Database Systems and Machine Learning.
